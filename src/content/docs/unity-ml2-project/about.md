title: XR Integration ML2
description: A quick description what the ARME Project system is and how it is used.

Another modality of using the Adaptive Metronome is through the usage of [Unity](https://unity.com/) and [Magic Leap 2](https://www.magicleap.com/magic-leap-2) to create an interactive application that applies the model to a practical usage.

### Requirement

You will find the required repository through this link: [XR Integration ML2](https://github.com/arme-project/ARME-XR-Integration-ML2)

In addition, you will need to install the following for the project to work:

1. [Unity 6](https://unity.com/releases/unity-6) (ideally Unity 60000.1.14f1) with Android Build Tools installed
2. [Magic Leap Hub 3](https://developer-docs.magicleap.cloud/docs/guides/developer-tools/ml-hub-3/get-started/)

You will need to make sure that the [Adaptive Metronome](https://github.com/arme-project/AdaptiveMetronome/tree/windows-standalone) and [score-follower](https://github.com/arme-project/score-follower) (Set to run through Unity) has been set up. Go through the section if it has not been done yet.

**Unity** is a cross-platform game engine used to create 2D, 3D, and XR (AR/VR) applications. It's widely used for developing interactive experiences due to its flexibility, real-time rendering, and support for multiple platforms.

**Magic Leap 2** is an augmented reality (AR) headset that features advanced spatial computing capabilities, allowing digital content to interact with the real world through 3D mapping, eye tracking, and hand gesture recognition.

We use the combination of the two to develope the XL Integration ML2 to allow us to use the correction model through the headset.
