description: A quick description what the ARME Project system is and how it is used.
---

The ARME Project's has put together three projects that build upon the previous project, the backbone being what we call the **Adaptive Metronome**. This documentation site will explain how to setup the both demonstration and development environments to get these projects to work in locally.

The following projects are as follows:
1. 🎛️ [Adaptive Metronome JUCE Plugin](/am-system-docs/juce-plugin/about/) – Standalone Plugin Executable.
2. 🎚️ [score-follower in MAX/MSP](/am-system-docs/max-msp-patch/about/) – Score Following and Audio Playback
3. 🥽 [Magic Leap 2 project in Unity](/am-system-docs/unity-ml2-project/about/) – AR visual interface and display

Each project is organised into **DEMO** (Instructions to setup a running demo) and **DEVELOPMENT** (Instructions for setting up full development environment)
