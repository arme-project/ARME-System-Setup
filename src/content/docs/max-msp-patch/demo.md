1. Download and install [MAX 9.0](https://cycling74.com/downloads).
1. Clone the **score-follower** repo.
1. Extract Antescofo package to a folder that MAX/MSP checks for external packages (**Expand these instructions**). 
1. Open the `score-follower.maxpat` patcher.
1. This should load the following interface:
1. Setup the required audio files in each Audio Player.
1. Choose which method of Onsets will be sent to the AdaptiveMetronome plugin. The current options are:
   - Simulated onsets based on a metronome (an Onset is generated automatically every 0.5s, for example).
   - Generate enerate onsets when the user taps the Spacebar (this can also be setup to use a connected MIDI device).
   - Onsets are generated by Antescofo (a score must be loaded into Antescofo. A pre-recorded audio file should play into Antescofo, or Audio should be routed directly from a mic input for full real-time use).
1. Use the **[Reset]** and **[Play]** buttons in either **MAX** or the **Adaptive Metronome** plugin to begin and reset playback.
